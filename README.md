# Getting Started with Kothahok App

The project has two part, Frontend and Backend. \
Frontend part was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Backend

Runs the server in the development mode.\
The server will run to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). \
You may also see logs and lint errors in the terminal.

## Frontend

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
