# Getting Started with Kothhok App

Kothhok is a proprietary videotelephony software app. Currently it allows up to 4 concurrent participants in a single room.

## Backend

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the server in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see logs and lint errors in the console.

## Frontend

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
